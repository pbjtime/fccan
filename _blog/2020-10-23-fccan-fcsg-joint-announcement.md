After much thought and careful consideration, the Fort Collins Sustainability Group (FCSG) and the Fort Collins Community Action Network (FCCAN) have decided to separate. Today, we jointly announce the departure of FCSG from FCCAN as an affiliate, effective immediately. FCSG will continue as an independent organization developing and advocating strategies for becoming a sustainable community, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with a livable climate. We are proud of our years of close affiliation and the community-focused work we have done together, and we look forward to finding new ways to continue to create change in our community and beyond.

Over the past year, FCCAN's Spokes Council has been engaged in a series of conversations, including formal mediation, about our organizational goals & priorities. While recognizing the history we share and all that we have in common, we have mutually decided that the two groups would do their work more effectively apart than together due to critical differences in our respective approaches to community organizing and our visions for the future.

We recognize that change is one of the few constants in the life of community organizations. Change can also be challenging! Although restructuring an organization can test relationships and patience, we believe that everyone involved has approached this with the best of intentions and with a commitment to finding solutions. We do not make the decision to separate lightly, but with the sincere belief that this will help both of our groups better utilize our strengths to continue fighting for people and the planet.

We jointly affirm the critical importance and value of the work of both the Fort Collins Community Action Network and the Fort Collins Sustainability Group. In the coming months and years, FCCAN will continue the work of coalition building around our core values with the goal of moving us towards a collective, life-affirming culture, and developing programs, strategies, and actions that further economic, social and environmental justice, human rights, dignity, sustainability, and peace for all. FCSG is looking forward to mobilizing people at the local, regional, and state levels to take action to address the multiple facets of the climate crisis. Both organizations affirm one another and pledge to support and honor each other's work as much as possible in the future.

We are deeply grateful for your support of FCCAN and FCSG over the years, and we look forward to your continued engagement in the future.

Sincerely,

FORT COLLINS COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK
