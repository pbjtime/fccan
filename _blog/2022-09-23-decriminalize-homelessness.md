In Fort Collins, resting & eating in public spaces is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless. Fort Collins does not have enough affordable housing, or even enough emergency services. Yet every year, police in Fort Collins write hundreds of tickets to poor and homeless people for the “crime” of sitting, sleeping, or resting in public spaces. Groups that share food with unhoused people have been targeted, and events shut down. Police disrupt people who are resting outside or in vehicles, threaten them with tow notices and tickets, and tell them to “move along.” Yet the reality is that there is often nowhere to go.

Homelessness is caused by failed federal housing policies, and is not being solved by today’s homeless assistance programs. Criminalization harms people and wastes resources, while moving us further from real solutions. We need a policy of universal housing for all.
