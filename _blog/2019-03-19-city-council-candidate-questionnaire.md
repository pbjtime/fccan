The ballets have been sent and the local city council elections are coming up on April 2, 2019! Keep scrolling for the FCCAN questionnaire or [view the PDF](http://fccan.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/FCCAN-City-Council-Questionnaire.-pdf.pdf).

The Fort Collins Community Action Network (FCCAN) mission is to create community based on furthering economic, social, and environmental justice, sustainability, human rights, and peace for all by building coalitions, developing strategies and actions, and supporting existing progressive organizations.

Having incredible impacts on Fort Collins community wellbeing, we believe our City Council is extremely important. We care about who is representing our communities' interests and how. With that in mind, FCCAN has prepared a short survey to give our communities more insight to who may be representing us. FCCAN is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and does not endorse any political candidates.

2. **Would you support raising the minimum wage for City employees to $15 per hour?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): No
        1. Minimum wage should be the same for all.  Government employees should not have an unfair income advantage over others.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): No

    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): No
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
        1. I support a repeal of U+2
4. **Do you think City Council has an equal obligation to represent and promote/protect the well-being of all residents of our city, regardless of their immigration status (including international students, other visa holders and persons without immigration status)?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): No
        1. The city function is to protect and promote the general welfare while honoring the rights of all people.  To achieve that goal, the city should take input from as many perspectives as possible, including citizens, residents, and visitors, but specifically committing to represent outsiders, is beyond the scope of city council.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
5. **Do you support allowing non-citizen residents of Fort Collins (i.e. Lawful Permanent Residents, visa holders, and persons with no immigration status) to vote in local elections, including City Council elections?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): No
        1. This would violate the law and oath of office.  Pruznick encourages advocates to lobby their state and federal representatives on this topic.  Pruznick welcomes and encourages non-citizens to be part of the various public input processes, but not voting.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): No
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): No
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
        1. I would like to do more research on #5 before completely committing to my yes answer.
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
6. **In 2017, the Community Trust Ordinance was presented to City Council, barring city employees from inquiring about legal status in an effort to encourage all residents of the city to seek services (including assistance from the police) without fear of repercussions or differential treatment based on immigration status. Did/do you support this measure?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
        1. I would like this resolution to go much further than it did at the time.
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
        1. I support the idea of a CTO. I need to talk with stakeholders to know how well it is working.
7. **Do you feel local government and local law enforcement should play a role in immigration policy enforcement?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): No
        1. Since 2014, murders are up 150%, rapes are up 48%, and overall crime is outpacing growth 2:1.  The city lost 19 officers in 2018 due to attrition since the city refused to include a continuation clause in the current contract.  Our federal taxes pay for immigration enforcement, let the federal government do its job. The city needs to focus on reducing murders and rapes.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): No
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): No
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): No
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): No
8. **Do you believe City Council has a duty to boldly decry acts of discrimination and hate in our community by issuing a timely, public statement, and creating a concrete evaluation and response plan to ensure such acts do not continue?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
        1. Pruznick has been such an advocate.  June 24th, 2014, Pruznick watched in shock as then council member Troxell ignored the staff report on the "frequent if not weekly rape of women in our natural areas and parks," and a few months later, supported the City Manager terminating the whistleblower.  Since then, rapes are up 48%, outpacing growth eight fold. Pruznick is committed to holding both those who commit acts of hate and those who enable and support acts of hate accountable. Rape is a violent hate crime against women. As long as leaders who put image before rights are protected and promoted, we will never solve our human rights problems.  Pruznick is committed to making human and environmental rights the city priority.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
9. **The Climate Action Plan Framework adopted by City Council in 2015 includes the following community greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals: 20% by 2020, 80% by 2030, and 100% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels.  Do you support these goals?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
        1. Pruznick is converting his home to be fossil fuel free.  Pruznick believes we can do better for less and is willing to lead by example.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
        1. I do support Fort Collins Climate Action Plan, I am cautious to overly burden our citizens with all the expenses associated with the plan. I think if we force people out of Fort Collins due to affordability we made actually hurt the goal rather than help it. By having more people commute in/out of the city we will increase the level of carbon output. Also, unfortunately when we lose tax dollar generated by folks living here the first programs that are reduced are normally social and environmental based.
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
        1. I think we need to move much, much faster and will commit to solutions as they present themselves that will allow that opportunity.
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
10. **Each year, City staff provides a “Community Carbon Inventory” report that tracks progress toward reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  If the report for 2018, scheduled for release this summer, suggests that we are not on track to achieve our 2020 climate goal, would you support a mid-cycle budget offer or offers designed to help us meet that target?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): No
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
11. **Over the next two years, City staff will develop a detailed plan for meeting the 2030 climate goal.  Are you prepared to support implementing the policies and making the investments that will be needed to achieve that goal?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
12. **Do you believe that the City should actively advocate for climate action -- and against climate damage such as greenhouse gas emissions from fracking -- in the broader policy arena, such as to County and State policy makers?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
13. **Do you agree with those in our community who say there is a lack of accessibility to public transportation?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
14. **Regardless if you agree, do you feel these concerns are important to address?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
15. **Is it your priority to involve Fort Collins residents in decision making processes who might normally be excluded (i.e. working class, undocumented, disabled, Queer, trans, people of color, Indigenous, women, and people of intersecting marginalized positionalities)?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): Yes
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): Yes
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
16. **Do you support Citizen-Initiated Charter Amendment #1, which would offer Fort Collins City council members full-time pay for full time work?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): No
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): No
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): No
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): No
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
17. **Would you support a future initiative to establish a ranked choice voting system for municipal elections?**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor): Yes
        1. Our nation and our community have become divided along political lines.  The current system favors the extremes who represent the party first, as evidenced by the longest government shutdown in history.  Ranked voting favors solution-focused moderates who will do a better job working together through compromise. Pruznick was a member of the Fort Collins Centrist group.
    2. Joe Somodi (District 1): Yes
    3. Susan Gutowsky (District 1): No
    4. Adam Eggleston (District 2): Yes
    5. Julie Pignataro (District 2): Yes
    6. Kristin Stevens (District 4): No
    7. Fred Kirsch (District 6): Yes
18. **Please provide any additional comments:**
    1. Michael Charles Pruznick (Mayor)
        1. In his role on the Larimer County Red Feather Lakes Board and the Fort Collins Loveland Water District Board, Pruznick has found solutions that have brought the extremes together.  Pruznick is committed to working together, as evidenced by his Wed, 7 Nov 2018, "120% Rule Compromise," email to City Leaders, his Thu, 25 Oct 2018, "Chamber and FCSG Should Work Together," email, and his NISP letter to the editor, linked below. http://vote.pruz.org/2018-10-15.chamber-fscg-work-together.txt http://vote.p ruz.org/2018-11-07.120-percent-compromise.txt [http://vote.pruz.org/2017-02-08.co-lte.nisp.pdf](http://vote.pruz.org/2017-02-08.co-lte.nisp.pdf)
    2. Noah Hutchison (District 2)
        1. My name is Noah Hutchison and I am running for District 2 City Council. I believe not only do I have what it takes to represent District 2 well, but I believe I will do it with passion and innovation. I am committed to working with as many people in this community as I can to resolve issues, to work on projects that benefit the city, and to ensure smart growth for years to come. I am committed to building strong communities that appreciate an elevated quality of life. I want to bring a balanced approach that work towards the most people possible having access to it. I am entering this race acknowledging the reality of the number of issues there are to tackle in the coming four years that affect many individuals in our city. I am committed to our economic development, to people, to our environment, to sustainability, to human rights and to peace. I am open to discussion on real solutions that can help the most individuals in Fort Collins experience involvement in this great city, its plan, its businesses, and its future. I am a supporter of the City Plan as I believe it will make headway over the next 20 years on a number of these issues you are concerned about including housing access, affordability, jobs, transportation, and more.

\*Please note I have answered this questionnaire with a statement because I feel my positions and decision making philosophy can be better represented than it would with yes/no question answers.

1. Kristin Stevens (District 4)
    1. Over the past four years, I have supported our Climate Action goals, voted to fund Sunday bus service, voted for lockers for those experiencing homelessness, and reached out to many residents including those who might normally be excluded. I am open to talking about many of the issues listed above even if I don't believe I support them. I am looking forward to working on equity issues, affordable housing, and transportation issues in the next 4 years.
