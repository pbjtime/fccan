October 3, 2018-

The Fort Collins Community Action Network (FCCAN) categorically opposes the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Much like the violence inherent in racism, sexism, ableism and other forms of oppression, which FCCAN recognizes as directly impacting our community, the senate hearings which we’ve all witnessed in the past week are about control and domination.

 

The nomination of Judge Kavanaugh exposes the intention of United States judicial system. It wasn’t built to bring any sort of justice for Dr. Ford or anyone else. Instead, it was built to maintain the power of those in control, namely white male colonizers and their heirs.

 

We received a very clear picture of how those in power act when that control is challenged. But the system is starting to waver- Indigenous, Black and Brown women have a long history of leading us in imagining a transformative future that is equitable, accountable and liberated, since the cusp of colonization of this land.

 

FCCAN is ready to follow their lead and stands in solidarity with those who have been resisting the violence of a patriarchal, white supremacist, colonizing ideology that this country was built on.
