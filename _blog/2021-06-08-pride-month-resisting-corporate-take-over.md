In case you haven't noticed, the corporate take-over of #PrideMonth has begun. 

As the general support for LGBTQ rights grows, so does the corporate incentive for brands and companies to position themselves in sync with that growing sentiment.

In that commercialization lies the disconnect: Brands promoting gay pride are not consistent in actually supporting the rights of the LGBTQ community, but they do manage to capitalize on the growing number of people (aka consumers) wanting to show support and solidarity.

**But in reality, all this commercialized support is ultimately utterly empty and harmful.**

The commercialization of Pride Month has blurred and simplified the ways to actually support LGBTQ folks. A first step has to be looking past the easy-to-sell concept of rainbow awareness'.

**Updating your log to display a rainbow flag ain't awareness if that is where your support ends!**

**It is our job to show solidarity not only during Pride Month, but all year long.** Supporting organizations that are queer-led such as [FCCAN](http://www.fccan.org/donate) and [Fuerza Latina](http://fuerzalatinafoco.org/) is one place to start.
