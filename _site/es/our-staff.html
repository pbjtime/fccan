She aspires to be a high school teacher and hopes to bring social justice into her classroom creating a safe second home for all her students. She is a big fan of traveling and meeting new people wherever she goes, her dream is to one day visit Spain.

When I’m not working on schoolwork, I enjoy tending my garden, taking sunny walks with my dog, eating all the vegan desserts, reading books in my hammock, smooshing my four cats, caring for my 100+ houseplants, taking pottery classes, and spending time with my friends, partner, and family.</p>

She works as a community organizer with the Fort Collins Community Action Network and as a yoga teacher. Shirley spends a lot of her time desperately trying to meld together two separate worlds- the body work/spiritual realm and social movement organizing. She’s combining her skills and knowledge from ethnic studies, women and gender studies and community organizing with her deepest passion (meditation, buddhism and yoga) to try to create something that can be transformative, healing and (gasp) pleasurable for her community. She is also prone to making poor jokes while traversing the rigors of being an organizer in a place like Fort Collins. When not being self- referential in a bio, you can find her playing with her dogs, biking around town, dancing, or reading a book. <br /></p>

She graduated from Colorado State University in 2021 earning a bachelor’s degree in Ethnic Studies and minor in legal studies. Her hobbies are spending time with loved ones, being in nature, boxing, fashion, and self-improvement. As a child, she observed her family members navigate the complex immigration system and always questioned the structures in place that affected our communities. The passion for empowering our communities inspired her academic and career trajectory. She  believes it is essential to understand the way particular structures leave a lasting impact and to promote fair and equitable rights for underrepresented communities.  She is beyond excited to be Fuerza Latina’s community organizer and collaborate in developing strategies that build power for our community members with our principle goal of protecting and promoting immigrant rights.</p>

She also sits on the steering committee of ISAAC – the Interfaith Sanctuary and Accompaniment Coalition – and is part of Plymouth Congregational’s immigration team. She considers herself a Buddeo-Christian and believes insight meditation and the prophetic Christian tradition are critical tools and grounding forces in her own social justice work. Prior to living in Colorado, Arpi spent nearly three years working with a cooperative in highland Guatemala. She returned to California to pursue her PhD in sociology at UCLA with an emphasis in international migration. For a decade, during her masters and doctoral work, she worked with veteran Salvadoran immigrant organizers in the Los Angeles area, where she feels she received an education better than any university. During that time, she traveled to El Salvador regularly to monitor elections and participate in delegations. She currently freelances as a research fellow with the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at USC, and plays mom to two boys and a yellow lab.</p>

She recently graduated from Colorado State University with her bachelor’s degree in Ethnic Studies and a minor in Women’s Studies. As she navigates post-grad life she spends much of her time trying to share knowledge and skills gained inside an academic institution and make it accessible to all people. Recently, she has been building knowledge and skills directly related to environmental justice by attending non-violent direct action camps led by Indigenous peoples. She believes there is great power that lies at the intersection of embodiment work, land-based practices, and social and environmental justice. Having access to clean air, water, and soil should be a basic human and non-human right, so until that is achieved and maintained for all beings, her body will remain on the frontlines. Pleasure activities include hiking, fishing, ethically hunting and gathering, creative resistance through art, dancing, eating food, and attending music concerts. She is a proud plant and puppy companion.</p>
