As the daughter of an Armenian Palestinian refugee, she grew up with constant stories of displacement, dispossession and migration. Following college, she moved to Guatemala to learn Spanish and better understand US intervention in Latin America. She stayed in the Western Highlands for two years working in a co-op of Guatemalan educators and activists. She returned to Los Angeles with a desire to study immigration and completed a doctorate in sociology at UCLA. During that time, she worked closely with Salvadoran immigrants in L.A. on issues of immigration justice and political change, traveling to Central America regularly with fact-finding delegations and elections observer teams. She began volunteering with Fuerza Latina during its DACA legal clinics in 2012 and stayed on as a volunteer coordinator with the hotline and ally education teams.</p>

            <p class="card-text"> <p>Susan grew up in California in the fifties and sixties, where her Cuban and Mexican godparents broadened her horizons with the gift of Spanish and a consciousness of Latinx culture.  In the late sixties she officially studied anthropology at the University of California in Riverside, but was primarily a student and activist in the turbulent social movements of the era. She moved to Fort Collins, Colorado with her partner Jon Slutsky in 1972, where she found a place in the local community activist group at The Point Community Center. She acquired a degree in Animal Science at Colorado State University and she and Jon have operated a dairy farm for nearly forty years. Working with immigrant employees has provided a close-up education on racism in the United States and kept her working for social justice in this country.&lt;br /&gt;
For nurturance and pleasure, she has the companionship of her partner Jon and daughter Raisa, and enjoys her garden, reading, and quilt making as well as old friends and the new ones she meets in the fight against the threat we are now confronting.</p>
