Since 2014, the Fort Collins Homeless Coalition (FCHC) has been standing up for dignity, rights, and housing. We work with and for people experiencing homelessness, on issues and injustices that are raised & affirmed by people who are homeless. Our power comes from organizing, mobilizing, and acting collectively — by working together, we fight to build a better world.
