name: Rena Trujillo, Community Representative
body-en: Rena Trujillo identifies as a queer, multiracial, Indigenous woman of
  color. She recently graduated from Colorado State University with her
  bachelor’s degree in Ethnic Studies and a minor in Women’s Studies. As she
  navigates post-grad life she spends much of her time trying to share knowledge
  and skills gained inside an academic institution and make it accessible to all
  people. Recently, she has been building knowledge and skills directly related
  to environmental justice by attending non-violent direct action camps led by
  Indigenous peoples. She believes there is great power that lies at the
  intersection of embodiment work, land-based practices, and social and
  environmental justice. Having access to clean air, water, and soil should be a
  basic human and non-human right, so until that is achieved and maintained for
  all beings, her body will remain on the frontlines. Pleasure activities
  include hiking, fishing, ethically hunting and gathering, creative resistance
  through art, dancing, eating food, and attending music concerts. She is a
  proud plant and puppy companion.
