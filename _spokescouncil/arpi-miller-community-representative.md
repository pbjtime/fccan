name: Arpi Miller, Community Representative
body-en: Arpi Miller works on the Fuerza Latina emergency immigration hotline
  and is a volunteer coordinator with the Education and Outreach team. She also
  sits on the steering committee of ISAAC – the Interfaith Sanctuary and
  Accompaniment Coalition – and is part of Plymouth Congregational’s immigration
  team. She considers herself a Buddeo-Christian and believes insight meditation
  and the prophetic Christian tradition are critical tools and grounding forces
  in her own social justice work. Prior to living in Colorado, Arpi spent nearly
  three years working with a cooperative in highland Guatemala. She returned to
  California to pursue her PhD in sociology at UCLA with an emphasis in
  international migration. For a decade, during her masters and doctoral work,
  she worked with veteran Salvadoran immigrant organizers in the Los Angeles
  area, where she feels she received an education better than any university.
  During that time, she traveled to El Salvador regularly to monitor elections
  and participate in delegations. She currently freelances as a research fellow
  with the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at USC, and plays mom to two
  boys and a yellow lab.
