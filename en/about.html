<p class="clearfix">The Fort Collins Community Action Network (FCCAN) is a solid grassroots organization comprised of independent affiliates.</p>
<p class="clearfix">FCCAN has been a driving force in Northern Colorado’s progressive movement for over eighteen years; many of its members have been active for over twenty years.</p>
<p class="clearfix">During that time, we have seen Northern Colorado experience dramatic changes due to growth, development, and shifts in the economic and social bases.</p>
<p class="clearfix">We have also seen the rise of single issue groups with limited resources and moderate success at coalition building.FCCAN brings cohesion to these community efforts.</p>
<p class="clearfix">Working together, we have created a viable community-oriented center with diverse leadership and participation that serves as an organizational vehicle for democratic and populist activism.</p>
<p class="clearfix">FCCAN is operated by a volunteer spokes council (board of directors); affiliates have their own volunteer steering committees.</p>
<p class="clearfix">FCCAN was incorporated in Colorado in December 2000, with our previous name, “the Center for Justice, Peace, and Environment.” We were established as a not-for-profit tax exempt organization in December 2001. In December of 2011, we changed our name to the Fort Collins Community Action Network.</p>
<p>For more information about how we organize ourselves to coalition build, we invite you to <a href="/affiliates/">read all about FCCAN and its Affiliates</a>. Thanks!</p>
