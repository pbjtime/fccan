body-en: My name is Rachel (she/they), and I’m working toward my graduate degree
  in social work at CSU. I am thrilled to be completing my internship with FCCAN
  these next few semesters and to be stepping into staff role as Community
  Organizer and learning just how the power of community can advance social
  justice. When I’m not working on schoolwork, I enjoy tending my garden, taking
  sunny walks with my dog, eating all the vegan desserts, reading books in my
  hammock, smooshing my four cats, caring for my 100+ houseplants, taking
  pottery classes, and spending time with my friends, partner, and family.
