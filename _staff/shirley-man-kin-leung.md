  Shirley identifies as a queer, asian-american woman of color. She works as a
  community organizer with the Fort Collins Community Action Network and as a
  yoga teacher. Shirley spends a lot of her time desperately trying to meld
  together two separate worlds- the body work/spiritual realm and social
  movement organizing. She’s combining her skills and knowledge from ethnic
  studies, women and gender studies and community organizing with her deepest
  passion (meditation, buddhism and yoga) to try to create something that can be
  transformative, healing and (gasp) pleasurable for her community. She is also
  prone to making poor jokes while traversing the rigors of being an organizer
  in a place like Fort Collins. When not being self- referential in a bio, you
  can find her playing with her dogs, biking around town, dancing, or reading a
  book.
