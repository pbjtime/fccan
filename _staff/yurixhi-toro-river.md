body-en: "Yurixhi was born and raised in Greeley Colorado. She graduated from
  Colorado State University in 2021 earning a bachelor’s degree in Ethnic
  Studies and minor in legal studies. Her hobbies are spending time with loved
  ones, being in nature, boxing, fashion, and self-improvement. As a child, she
  observed her family members navigate the complex immigration system and always
  questioned the structures in place that affected our communities. The passion
  for empowering our communities inspired her academic and career trajectory.
  She  believes it is essential to understand the way particular structures
  leave a lasting impact and to promote fair and equitable rights for
  underrepresented communities.  She is beyond excited to be Fuerza Latina’s
  community organizer and collaborate in developing strategies that build power
  for our community members with our principle goal of protecting and promoting
  immigrant rights.  "
