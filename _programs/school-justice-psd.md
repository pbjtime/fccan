**Want to get involved with our campaign?**

School Justice PSD is a multi-stakeholder coalition of students, parents, educators and advocates who demand justice in the Poudre School District (PSD)- we know that PSD can and must do better than respond with excuses and delays. Instead of leading, PSD, is falling behind. Our campaign came together in the summer of 2020, in the wake of racist murders by police, cities across the country are reexamining policing. This resulted in school districts across the country cancelling contracts with police and otherwise shrinking police presence in places of learning.

**We have a very good chance of making our schools police free in 2021 but it will take all of us to be organized together!**

**Below are some resources, including talking points.  In the middle of a pandemic, the PSD should be finding ways to save money, not waste money on police when there are no students in school. We invite you to speak out and let your voices be heard:**

* **Email the school board, let them know how you feel** 
* **Join Public Comment! You can also join our writing workshops the day before to prepare with us**
* **[Send](http://fccan.org/contact/) us your thoughts and ideas to further the reach of your voice**
