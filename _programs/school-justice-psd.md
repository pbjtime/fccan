**Creating Healthy, Equitable and Inclusive Schools – Ending the Criminalization of Students in School**

School Justice PSD believes that all students, regardless of race, income, or immigration status, deserve safe, healthy, and equitable learning environments.

Since June 2020, School Justice PSD has worked to eliminate barriers to this vision and ensure that every child has access to a safe, nurturing environment where they can thrive.

Through our work we will build access to schools that uplift and nurture our students by abolishing all forms of policing, surveillance, and harm and provide quality education, mental health services, and access to holistic care.

School Justice PSD is a multi-stakeholder coalition of students, parents, educators and advocates who demand justice in the Poudre School District (PSD)- we know that PSD can and must do better than respond with excuses and delays. Instead of leading, PSD, is falling behind. Our campaign came together in the summer of 2020, in the wake of racist murders by police, cities across the country are reexamining policing. This resulted in school districts across the country cancelling contracts with police and otherwise shrinking police presence in places of learning.

**Immigrant Justice**

School Justice PSD understands that migrantes and Latine’s are an integral part of the Northern Colorado story. But our immigration policies work to terrorize, alienate and suppress our families, coworkers, and neighbors. School Justice PSD works from the ground up to ensure that our gente can lead us to a world where they have dignity, racial justice, and the freedom to move and thrive. This means a society where immigrant families are treated as first class citizens, free from the fear of deportation, family separation, policing, surveillance, and all systems of oppression with equitable access to education, healthcare, and housing.

**Below are some resources and ways to get involved.  In these troubling times, the PSD should be finding ways to save money, prioritize safety for ALL students & not waste money on police when there are no students in school. We invite you to speak out and let your voices be heard:**
